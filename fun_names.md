Mathematicians and physicists like to name things in very silly ways. This is a great motivator: I will often read about something just because of a fun name. I'm going to try to gather some of them here, please amuse yourself! (Contrived acronyms, especially those in astronomy and machine learning to name specific projects, are excluded. They are both too common, and usually name a particular _work_; I am more interested in pure mathematical _objects_
that have been named something funny.)

 * ***Okubunions***, [2023](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2309.17435): originally studied by Okubo in 1978 and given their new name later, these are a modification of _octonions_ that lack identity or alternativity. They may have applications in quantum chromodynamics, see also _the eightfold way_.
 * ***Minions***: [1](https://math.colorado.edu/algebralogic/ulam2021/slides/seminar9.pdf), [2](https://math.colorado.edu/algebralogic/ulam2021/slides/seminar9.pdf), [3](https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~barto/Articles/Barto_Obervolfach21_UA_tutorial.pdf). These are sets of functions $A^k \to B$ over varying $k$, which are closed under "adding a dummy argument" and "copying an argument". Those two operations which let you increase or decrease $k$ by one, respectively. They are a weakening of a _[clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_(algebra))_. 
* ***The Eightfold Way***: [this system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_way_(physics)) is a perspective on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) punningly named after the [Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path) of buddhism. The Eightfold Way is a way to organize and classify bound states of quarks, aka hadrons. Since QCD uses $SU(3)$, and $3^2-1 = 8$ counts the 3x3 matrices that aren't the identity (1), the number 8 ocurrs a lot.
* ***Weft***: The [weft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity#W_hierarchy) of a circuit measures how many "wide" gates are needed to keep it a low depth. The exact definition is long and somewhat clunky, but the weft turns out to nicely characterize a lot of complexity theoretic separations in the parameterized world. The term comes from the [warp and weft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft) of weaving.
