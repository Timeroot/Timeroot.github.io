![image](https://github.com/Timeroot/Timeroot.github.io/assets/568733/346cc237-487e-4f15-b224-586bd4f3546b)Mathematicians and physicists like to name things in very silly ways. This is a great motivator: I will often read about something just because of a fun name. I'm going to try to gather some of them here, please amuse yourself! (Contrived acronyms, especially those in astronomy and machine learning to name specific projects, are excluded. They are both too common, and usually name a particular _work_; I am more interested in pure mathematical _objects_
that have been named something funny.)

 * **Okubunions**, [2023](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2309.17435): originally studied by Okubo in 1978 and given their new name later, these are a modification of _octonions_ that lack identity or alternativity. They may have applications in quantum chromodynamics, see also _the eightfold way_.
 * **Minions**: [1](https://math.colorado.edu/algebralogic/ulam2021/slides/seminar9.pdf), [2](https://math.colorado.edu/algebralogic/ulam2021/slides/seminar9.pdf), [3](https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~barto/Articles/Barto_Obervolfach21_UA_tutorial.pdf). These are sets of functions $A^k \to B$ over varying $k$, which are closed under "adding a dummy argument" and "copying an argument". Those two operations which let you increase or decrease $k$ by one, respectively. They are a weakening of a _[clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_(algebra))_. 
* **The Eightfold Way**: [this system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_way_(physics)) is a perspective on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) punningly named after the [Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path) of buddhism. The Eightfold Way is a way to organize and classify bound states of quarks, aka hadrons. Since QCD uses $SU(3)$, and $3^2-1 = 8$ counts the 3x3 matrices that aren't the identity (1), the number 8 ocurrs a lot.
* **Weft**: The [weft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity#W_hierarchy) of a circuit measures how many "wide" gates are needed to keep it a low depth. The exact definition is long and somewhat clunky, but the weft turns out to nicely characterize a lot of complexity theoretic separations in the parameterized world. The term comes from the [warp and weft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft) of weaving.
* **Ne**: Not used seriously (yet!), but a "ne" is another name for a "[co-cone](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mapping+cocone)": a categorical dual of a [mapping cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_cone_(homological_algebra)). In principal this term could be applied in convex optimization too, where cones are [ubiquitous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_cone) as is [duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(optimization)#Dual_problem). This humor is in the same vein as [ffee](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/900568/127777).
* **Genetic**, **Gametic**, **Zygotic**: These are types of [algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field) arising in the study of genetic populations. They are non-associative (not even power associative), but they are commutative and "third power associative". [Genetic](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Genetic_algebra) algebras describe generally how populations multiply to produce new distributions of offspring. [Gametic](https://www.math.uci.edu/~brusso/etheringtonILL.pdf) describes distributions of gametes in particular. Zygotic describes distribution of zygotes (two copies each) created by _[duplication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385725882800012/)_ of the gametic algebra, and further duplicating the zygotic algebra leads to the _copular_ algebra. There is also the [sex-linked zygotic algebra](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02339487), which is a direct sum of male (n-dimensional) and female ($n(n+1)/2$-dimensional) algebras.
* **Monogamy**: The [monogamy of entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy_of_entanglement) is an important concept in quantum information that a particle A can't be maximally entangled with B while also being maximally entangled with C. In this sense, A can only fully "marry" one of B or C. There are approximate and quantitative versions of this, and it has applications in quantum cryptography.
* **Pancakes**: There are [pancake graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_graph), pancake numbers, and the pancake problem; and their "burnt" equivalent (burnt pancake graphs etc). Notably the subject of Bill Gates' undergrad work, these are [still](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11295) under [active](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00878) research.
* **Taco**: The [Hegelian taco](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Hegelian+taco) is a particular 8-element monoid, so-named by because it [looks like a taco](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Hegel_taco.png). 🌮! The taco also happens to be a [shelf](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/shelf); see "shelf" below.

![A hegelian taco](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Hegel_taco.png)

* **Quandle**: A [quandle](https://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/VNelson/quandles.html) is a strange little algebraic object that shows up most in knot theory. David Joyce chose the name simply to be a [nonsense word](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/05/the_origin_of_the_word_quandle.html) that would avoid collision and confusion with existing words like "algebra" or "group".
* **Rack**: Closely related to quandles, [racks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racks_and_quandles) are a quandle without an identity. Their name, originally "wrack", was a pun by John Conway on his colleague Gavin Wraith, and the phase [wrack and ruin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wrack#English). Their name gave the inspiration later for _shelves_ (next entry).
* **Shelf**: If you can put things on a rack, why not on a [https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/algebra/quandle.html#shelf](shelf) too? [Shelves](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/shelf) are racks that (are allowed to) lack inverses.
* **Gömböc**: A [gömböc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6mb%C3%B6c) is a 3-dimensional object that will always roll to a single equilibrium. They were only proven to exist in 2006, but now anyone can 3D print one as a little desk toy.

![A gomboc](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Gomboc2.jpg/1280px-Gomboc2.jpg)

* **Sober**: A topological [space is sober](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sober_space) if it avoids certain pathological properties. [Locales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_Heyting_algebra), an alternate way to begin axiomatizing topology, have their own pathological cases -- but a topological space is a locale iff it is sober. (A locale is a topological space iff it is _spatial_.)
* * **Pointless**: By the way, the study of locales avoid an axiomatic notion of a "point", so their study is usually called [pointless topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_topology). A more generous name is "point-free". This is similar in spirit to the style of [pointless programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming), especially popular in functional programming, where individual values avoid mentioning - only functions between them.
* A [**Roman** surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_surface) is simply named because it occurred to Jacob Steiner while he was in Rome.
* **Hydra**: There are [hydra games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_game) and associated hydra numbers, so-called because they are described by cutting heads off a tree that lead to more heads. They are used in describing very fast-growing sequences of numbers, and probing [the limits of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein%27s_theorem) Peano arithmetic.
* **Busy Beaver**: Even faster numbers arise from the [Busy beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver) sequence.
* **Buildings**, **Apartments**, and **Chambers**: [These](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_(mathematics)) describe certain manifolds in an abstract form. Buildings are made out of apartments, which are in turn made out of chambers. Sometimes these are referred to as "Tits buildings" (see the "Surnames" section below).
* **Clopen**: Although "[open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set)" and "closed" are basic concepts in topology, they are not mutually exclusive: a set can be both open _and_ closed at the same time. Such a set is called [clopen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopen_set).
* * **Door**: Perhaps we wish to somehow force open and closed to be opposites. It's hard to exclude all clopen sets, as the empty set and whole space must always be clopen (this is part of the axioms of a topological space). But we can ensure that these are _only_ two exceptions. Such a space is called _connected_. On the flip side, we might ask that every set is at least one of open or closed -- no sets are neither one. Such spaces exist, and are called [_door spaces_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_space). 
* **HaPPY**: The [Happy code](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HaPPY+code) is a quantum error correcting code named after its authors: Daniel **Ha**rlow, Fernando **P**astawski, John **P**reskill, Beni **Y**oshida. This was not the order of the names on the paper: "Fernando Pastawski, Beni Yoshida, Daniel Harlow, John Preskill", _Holographic quantum error-correcting codes: Toy models for the bulk/boundary correspondence_. Harlow [describes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01040) agonizing over the author order:

> We immediately found ourselves in a quandary however: although in high-energy physics author lists are almost always alphabetical, in this case it was clear to all of us that we should acknowledge the key role played by Fernando and Beni. The problem however was that doing this would destroy one of the best author acronyms any of us had ever encountered. After agonizing about this for several weeks, we decided that in the end we simply had to feature Fernando and Beni [11]. I am glad we did. Nonetheless it was a pity to lose the acronym, so we started to use it anyways to colloquially refer to the construction: thus the HaPPY code was born.

![The HaPPY code](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/HaPPYCodeTesselation.jpg)

* **Monster**: The [Monster group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine) is the largest sporadic simple group, sometimes known as the **Friendly giant**. It has a **[Baby monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_monster_group)** inside it, as well as many others; the sporadic simple groups _not_ inside are deemed **[Pariahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pariah_group)**. The study of it led to **[Monstrous moonshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine)**, an incredible and very deep program into mathematical symmetries of all sorts.
* **Arthur**, **Merlin**: These two characters play various games to convince Arthur of true statements. There are complexity classes named [Merlin-Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%E2%80%93Merlin_protocol) and [Arthur-Merlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%E2%80%93Merlin_protocol) accordingly. They have had recent forays into the [quantum world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QMA) as well.
* **Your**: The complexity class $P^{TALLY - (NP \cap coNP)}$ has been [referred to](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:Y#yp) as "Your Polynomial". Here the "You" is Scott Aaronson, who felt a need to discuss the class. It has been somewhat retconned to stand for **Yaroslav-Percival**. Percival [was chosen](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=77#comment-1713) as a friend of Arthur (see Arthur, Merlin), and Yaroslav because, well, a name was needed with a Y. He must be a recent Eastern European immigrant to Camelot.
* **Catalysis**: A [quantum catalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_catalyst) is a state that permits certain ways of accelerating or improving communnication, despite never being "used up" as a resource - its mere presence helps. The process by which it helps is called [catalysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03489). There is a similar but entirely unrelated notion of [catalytic space](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:C#cspace) for Turing machines, and corresponding classes CSPACE and CL.
* **Games Against Nature**: A certain type of computation with existential and randomized operators allows a computer to play a "game against nature", with a resulting [complexity class](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:G#ganspace) called GANSPACE. The relationship to CAHSPACE (Cards Against Huamnity Space) is hitherto unknown, but likely would cause PH to collapse to the third level.
* **Oblivious**: Certain computations can be done _obliviously_ if their memory access patterns do not depend on the input data. On the practical level, this gives rise to oblivious [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_data_structure) and [transfer protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_transfer). On the theoretical side, there's oblivious [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_RAM), [Turing machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine_equivalents#Oblivious_Turing_machines), and corresponding [complexity classes](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:O#OIP:_Oblivious_IP). There's a similar but distinct notion of [cache-oblivious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache-oblivious_algorithm) algorithms, such as [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache-oblivious_distribution_sort).
* **Stoic**: Problems can be solved be a [stoic](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:S#spp) algorithm if the accepting and rejecting paths follow certain constraints.
* **Platypus**: The [platypus channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08380) is a particular _quantum channel_, that is, a model of how quantum data might become corrupted. It has many surprising and counterintutive features, hence the name.
* **Pants**: A [pair of pants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_of_pants_(mathematics)) is a particular topological manifold-with-boundary which can be used to decompose other, more complicated surfaces. This forms a _pair-of-pants_ decomposition. There are associated _pants complexes_ and _hyperbolic pants_.

![Two pair of pants decompositions](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Pants_decomposition_genus2.png)
Pictured: Two inequivalent pants decompositions.

* **Ham Sandwich**: The [ham sandwich theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich_theorem) is a statement about equally dividing multiple "substances" (subsets of R^n) in an even way, with a plane. That, intuitively, you can cut a ham sandwich with three ingredients (bread, cheese, and ham) in half, such that each half of the sandwich has half of each ingredient. This is possible with at most three ingredients, because we live in three dimensions. In one dimension, this theorem is the fact a [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) exists, and in two dimensions, it is known as the "pancake theorem" (that you can cut a pancake to get half of the batter and half of the chocolate chips: two dimensions, two ingredients).
* **Banana Man**: The [Banach analytic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_manifold) form a category, and the convention for naming categories is to take the first three letters (or, most representative three). For instance, topological spaces are "Top", and groups are "Grp". When multiple words are present, they are combined. Under this convention, the category of Banach analytic manifolds are known as "BanAnaMan". A good argument against picking a shorter abbreviation!
* **Chicken McNuggets**: The [Chicken McNugget theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Chicken_McNugget_Theorem) states that for any two relatively prime positive integers $m,n$, the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form $am + bn$ for nonnegative integers $a, b$ is $mn-m-n$. So called because it arises from a problem: if a store sells chicken nuggets only in boxes of (say) $m=9$ and $n=20$, what is the smallest order you could _not_ place? The answer is 151, and for any value above 191 there is a way to build your order. In other contexts this is known as the Frobenius [**Coin problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem), and gives rise to the [**McNugget numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem#McNugget_numbers).
* **Pin**: The [pin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_group) is a certain topological group. The pun is involed. Before the pin group, came the **O**rthgonal group $O(n)$, and from this was built the **S**pecial **O**rthogonal group $SO(n)$. These had a relationship where $O(n)$ acted like "two copies" of $SO(n)$. Later, physicists worked with the Spin group, $Spin(n)$. Subsequently, it was found that one could take "two copies" in much the same way. Well, if taking two copies of $SO(n)$ was "dropping the S", the double of $Spin(n)$ should be $Pin(n)$. The name was also intended as a dirty joke on the French word _pine_, slang for penis.

## Particles
Particle physicists like to give some particles amusing names.
* **Stop**: A [stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_squark) is a supersymmetric partner particle of a top quark. The convention is to prefix an "s"[^s_prefix] to the standard name of a particle, e.g. "electron" becomes "selectron". Stop squarks are important because they would be the lightest supersymmetric particle, and thus the first one found, if supersymmetry were true (it likely is not). Other funny names include "sup" and, if you're a German speaker, "stau": "stau" is the German word for "traffic jam".
* **Anyon**: Not to be confusion with _anions_ or good ol' _onions_, [anyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon) are particles that are neither fermions nor bosons. Since they don't fit into either class, they can be _any_-thing else they want to, hence the name! They cannot exist as legitimate particles in a universe with at least three spatial dimensions (like ours), and this is part of the [spin-statistics theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93statistics_theorem); but they can exist as effective quasiparticles in 2D surfaces. They are often categorized as Abelian or non-abelian anyons. Recently, the term [**Nonabelion**](https://phys.org/news/2023-05-nonabelions-quantum-prone-errors.html) has come into use, although the (decidedly less exciting) "abelion" has not caught on.
* **Onium**: The unstable particles known as [onia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onium) are made of a particle and their own antiparticle.
* **Glueball**: These [hypothetical particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glueball) consist of many gluons that are "glued" together. Actually, **gluon** is already a funny word, so named because they "glue" protons and neutrons together -- but at this point we're all largely used to the name, and it's lost most of its humor.
* **Ghosts**: These [virtual particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faddeev%E2%80%93Popov_ghost) simplify certain calculations.
* **Skyrmions**: Named after Tony Skyrme, [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyrmion) particles have earned a truly bizarre name. They are also known as **hedgehog solutions**; see below for the related hedgehog theorem.
* **Penguins**: [Penguin diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_diagram) are an important class of interactions in particle physics. They are "one-loop" diagrams, which is the second-simplest kind of interaction -- the simplest are "tree-level" diagrams. Usually the tree-level diagrams are the most important, but in some cases -- for particular quantities one may care about, such as CP violation -- penguin diagrams actually become more important. They are so named simply because they look like a penguin.

 ![Penguin diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Penguin_diagram.JPG)

## Graphs
There are many named graphs of small size. While larger important ones are often simply named after humans who studied them (e.g. "Tutte cage" or "Higman-Sims graph"), small enough ones are just given descriptive names. There are [too many](https://www.graphclasses.org/smallgraphs.html) to refer to entirely, but some choice ones are:


Paw, Claw, Gem, Jewel, Butterfly (aka Hourglass), Fork (aka Chair), Kite, Dart, House, Bull, Cricket, Cross, "H", "A", "R", "E", "P" (graphs that look like their respective letters), Banner, Net, Domino, Fish, Antenna, Longhorn, Eiffel Tower, Rising Sun, Parachute, Parapluie.

The letter-named graphs can be remembered by the mnemonic [raphe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphe), in the unlikely event that that is a word you know. Sometimes the letter "I" is included to mean the 2-vertex complete graph. There are also some _series_ of graphs with nice names:

Pan, Sun, Star, Triad, Spider, Wheel, Ladder, Ladder Rung, Cocktail Party, Sunlet, Crown, Apple, Bicycle, Building, Fan, Hole, Windmill, Gear, Helm, Web

Then there are _classes_ of graphs, with certain properties. There's [Cactus](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_108.html) graphs, [Caterpillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_tree), [Lobsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphs#Lobster), and [Cop-win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cop-win_graph) graphs -- as in, a cop can beat a robber in a game. Graphs can be [slim](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_680.html), [slender](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_702.html), or even [skeletal](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_703.html). They can be [charming](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_676.html), [graceful](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_783.html), [harmonius](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_783.html), and [pretty](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_609.html). They could be [good](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_112.html) or even [perfect](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_56.html). They could even go beyond and be [strongly perfect](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_267.html), [very strongly perfect](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_265.html), or [absolutely perfect](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_146.html). They may be [murky](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_218.html). Finally, there are some things they can be that shouldn't ever have become adjectives: graphs could be [coin](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_955.html) (which is synonmous with being planar), they might be [visibility](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_419.html), or they might just be [bip*](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_57.html).

Another important class is the [Snarks](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Snark.html), including Flower snarks.

Besides the well known terms "cycle", "path", and "walk" in a graph, there is the slightly less common "[circuit](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circuit.html)" and the rare **[trail](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trail.html)**.

Some graph properties have funny names. While "tree" and "leaf" are pretty common, there's also _arboricity_, [_foliage_](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.106.L010401) and [_foliage partitions_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07645).

## Curves

People like to name particular curves.

* The [limaçon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima%C3%A7on) comes from the French word for "snail", and indeed is sometimes called _Pascal's snail_. It comes in four varieties: the convex limaçon, the dimpled limaçon, the looped limaçon, and the cardioid.
* [Wittgenstein's rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein%27s_rod) might belong in the "dirty jokes" section, but is funny name even without any obscene connotation. Oddly, the curve looks nothing like a rod: the rod is the bar used to _create_ the curve. And yet, the curve is called the rot.

## Surnames

Sometimes a name is funny not deliberately, but because it is named after someone whose name was already a word. How funny or surprising this can be is entirely dependent on how familiar the name is a word vs as a name. For instance, most native English speakers will not think "Taylor polynomial", "[Smith number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmithNumber.html)", or "[Stone duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_duality)" sound funny, even though "tailor", "smith", and "stone" are all words (each of them a noun _and_ verb!). My bias here in terms of what I find funny is certainly a function of what languages I know and how well. Please email me with suggestions!
 * A **[Knödel graph](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/KnoedelGraph.html)** is a particular class of graphs suggested by W. Knödel in 1975 to model gossiping. "Knödel" is the German for [dumpling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del). Coincidentally, but the Hungarian word for a Knodel is "gombóc", from which the mathematical term "Gömböc" is derived, see above. It's entirely reasonable to say that the funnier name from W. Knödel's 1975 paper is the problem he studied, which has become known as the **[gossiping problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00505)** or **gossiping process**.

![Two German leberknodeln in a bowl of beef stock soup](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Leberknoedelsuppe.jpg/1024px-Leberknoedelsuppe.jpg)
Pictured: A bipartite Knödel grap

 * [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein) has several objects, such as **[Klein bottles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle)** and two different **[Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_surface) [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch_surface)**, named after him. "Klein" is German for "small". This is the source of frequent puns in German, where Klein bottles are criticized for being "too small to hold anything", a reference to their zero-volume interior. _Klein bottle_ was already a mistake: in German, the name was "Klein Fläche", meaning "a Klein surface" (no relation to the other two). A translator misread "Fläche" and "Flasche", meaning "bottle", believing it to be a reference to the apparent bottle-like shape. The English name stuck. It is now known as "Flasche" (or something "Schlauch") in German too.
 * There are many **Haar** objects in math, such as [Haar measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_measure) and [Haar graphs](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HaarGraph.html), named after the Hungarian mathematician [Alfréd Haar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfr%C3%A9d_Haar). The surname "Haar" means "cold sea fog" in English and Scots; "hair" (of one's head) in German, Dutch, and Afrikaans; and "hare" (rabbit) in Middle English.
 * A **[Poisson process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process)** or [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) is named after [Siméon Denis Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson). His name "poisson" means "fish" in French. This has been used for puns before, e.g. the Poisson process in [this video](https://youtu.be/XchqR71vikk?si=6YO5-teabss3WkEX&t=317) is generated by an actual goldfish. (Skip to 5:17.)
 * **[Frucht graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frucht_graph)** are named after Robert Frucht. The name "Frucht" is German for "fruit".
 * **[Heyting algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra)** are not for people who hate algebras. They are named for [Arend Heyting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arend_Heyting). There is a similar joke where a knot theorist asks a young student what branch of math and sciences they enjoy. The student, who aspires to be an engineer, replies: "well... not theory". The professor is delighted.
 * **[Killing fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_vector_field)** and **[Killing forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_form)** are named after [Wilhelm Killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Killing). Wikipedia suggests that Killing fields are sometimes known simply as "Killings", which I hope is not very true.
 * A **[Boy's surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy%27s_surface)** is appropriate for all ages!
 * **[Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms)** describes all natural numbers, not just [the first 88](https://www.broughtonpianos.co.uk/blog/how-many-keys-on-a-piano).
 * There are a few **[Valiant](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:V#vp)** languages, named after [Leslie Valiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Valiant).
 * A **[Griess algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griess_algebra)** tells you nothing about slippery oil. It doesn't even tell you anything about [semolina](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/german-english/griess).
 * The **[Leech lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice)** won't leave you with bite marks, but it is full of **deep holes**. It provides optimal solutions to many **[kissing number](https://cohn.mit.edu/kissing-numbers)** problems as well.
 * As irony would have it, the **[Held group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Held_group)** is an abstract object, and has never once been hugged.

Some names are only "schoolboy funny".
 * There are [**Dyck** words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyck_language)** which make up the Dyck language.
 * The [**Cox-Zucker** machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%E2%80%93Zucker_machine) was deliberately named for this purpose.
 * [Jacques **Tits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Tits) has a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tits_group), an [alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tits_alternative), a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tits_metric), an [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satake_diagram), a [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_complex#Chambers_and_the_Tits_cone), and a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(B,_N)_pair) with his name on them.
 * Of no relation, the [Tarski indefinability theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem) is sometimes referred as the TIT.
 * There are [**Kummer** surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kummer_surface) and associated [Kummer varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kummer_variety) and [Kummer configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kummer_configuration), as well as [many other objects bearing his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Kummer#See_also).
 * The [**Wiener** process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process) generates a [**Wiener** sausage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_sausage). The latter is a deliberate pun on Viennese sausage ("Wiener" is German for "Viennese").
 * The [**Fokker**-Planck equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation) for particle distribution bears no connection to the [**Fokker** periodicity block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_periodicity_block) for scale tuning theory except for the namesake, Adriaan Fokker.
 * A [**Wick** rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wick_rotation) could be pleasant or very painful, depending on the angular velocity.
 * Many objects bear name **Hardy-Littlewood**, such as their [maximal functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood_maximal_function), their [zeta-function conjectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood_zeta-function_conjectures), or their [circle method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood_circle_method) to name just a few.

## Dirtier jokes
 * The language WPP also known as [**Wide PP**](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:W#wpp) was poor choice. Its even naughtier cousin is the [**Length-dependent Wide PP**](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:L#lwpp).
 * The [**hairy ball theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem) states that there is no nonzero tangent vector field on a sphere (or any sphere in an even number of dimensions). So called because it can be summed up as "you can't comb a hairy ball flat". In Europe it has earned the affectionate name of the **hedgehog theorem**.

[^s_prefix]: One would think that the "s" in a particle name stands for "super-" or "symmetric partner". Wikipedia [claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sfermion) that the s actually stands for "scalar", because the particles are spin-0 and therefore scalar fields. I'm skeptical, and can't find a citation. Bosons get a different naming convention, where the final "-on" is changed to "-ino", e.g. _photino_.
