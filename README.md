## Hello!

I'm a PhD candidate at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/) studying algorithms for quantum physics. I am interested in a good variety of the different ways that quantum physics, information and complexity theory, and pure math intersect. I am advised by [Bela Bauer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=38AoAQ8AAAAJ&hl=en) and my research is funded my [Microsoft Station Q](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/belabaue/). My undergrad was at Caltech where I earned a dual B.S. in Math and Physics.

Below I've gathered my more successful pursuits. You can also check out [my blog](http://blog.ohaithe.re), <a href='javascript:;' id='email_button' onclick='document.getElementById("email_button").outerHTML=atob("ZW1haWwgbWU6IGFsZXhAb2hhaXRoZS5yZSwgb3IgYW1laWJ1cmdAdWNzYi5lZHU=");'>email me (click to show)</a>, or look at [other links](/links.html).  Here's a link to [my resume](resume.pdf).

### Academic Works
 * In 2016, I learned interested in the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture, which was actually proved independently by [Zhuk](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01914) and [Bulatov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03021) at essentially the same time in 2017. This states that all constraint problems are in **P**  or are **NP-Complete**. Since quantum constraint problems were known to include at least the additional cases of **QMA_1**, and **MA**, I wanted to know what other possibilities there were -- the obvious one being **BQP**, the problems efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. I successfully [showed this in 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08381), also getting the cases **QCMA** and **coRP** in the priocess.
 * I was trying to work out some more exact formulas for [Quantum State Tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tomography) when I realized that the expressions were in fact [matrix permanents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_(mathematics)). I failed to find an efficient algorithm for computing these formulas, and instead showed that they were NP-hard to compute. But, [this resolved an important open problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03142) about the hardness of Positive Semidefinite Permanents, which [arise in thermal BosonSampling problems](https://strawberryfields.ai/photonics/demos/run_boson_sampling.html) and has [been discussed in several contexts](http://ieee-focs.org/FOCS-2017-Papers/3464a914.pdf).
 * My work with my advisor has involved applying Gaussian Fermionic Matrix Product States to more efficiently simulate quasi-1D fermion systems (read: problems involving electrons, where the material is much longer than it is wide). [Our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02088) showed that we could use this to e.g. explore superconductivity at weak couplings much faster and more accurately.
 * I have a forthcoming work involving the [irrationality measure](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IrrationalityMeasure.html) of pi and the [Flint-Hills series](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FlintHillsSeries.html), getting a converse of [Max Alekseyev's earlier work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5100).
 * The summer before college I worked with the [Climate Hazards Center](https://chc.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB's Geography department. My small portion of the work consisted of trying various ways to filter clouds out of infrared satellite imagery, in order to infer a more complete temperature record. [The paper](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/32/17/jcli-d-18-0698.1.xml) has more citations than the rest of my work combined, ironically.

### Computer Security

In high school I co-founded 1064CBread, a [competitive computer-hacking team](https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/what-is-ctf). We won first place in [PicoCTF 2013](https://picoctf.org/about), which was aimed at high schoolers. We then decided to aim higher at the college-level [CSAW CTF](https://www.csaw.io/ctf). To our surprise, we qualified for the finals, and got to fly across the country to NYC. After that we had a decently successful run, becoming finalists or winners in quite a number of competitions and winning prize money here and there. Although we've been less active in recent years, we were finalists in [Hack-A-Sat 2020](https://www.hackasat.com/hackasat1), an Air Force competition about satellite hacking, where _**we won $10k and a satellite**_.

You can [find a lot of my writeups on my blog](https://blog.ohaithe.re/search/ctf). The team also has [a Github repo](https://github.com/1064CBread), and [a CTFTime page](https://ctftime.org/team/5320).

I've also played with UCSB's team [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/index.html) a few times, although I've never been a core member by any means.

#### Bugs

In 2016, I found a security vulnerability in Facebook Messenger and received a bug bounty for reporting it. They promptly fixed it.

In 2012 I found a trivially exploitable vulnerability in a popular online education platform. They have still have not patched it, despite a few reminders on my part.

In 2020 I found a vulnerability in a popular online cloud computing platform. It was patched quicky, but sadly I did not receive a bounty, and they've expressed that they would prefer I not talk about it publically -- as some users likely using old versions of the software locally and could remain vulnerable.

### Finance

I've enjoyed applying my math knowledge to win some money with [Quantiacs](https://quantiacs.com/). My code has managed several million USD for them over the years, and [they came to Caltech and did an inteview with me](https://quantiacs.com/community/topic/19/interview-with-alex-trust-the-numbers). It's given me a useful side-income. I think that a worrying large fraction of quantitative finance is essentially numerology, and that approaches should either rely on news and principals (which I will readily I admit I know nothing about) or principled mathematical foundations - _not_ just drawing lines on a graph or magic numbers.

Here are some examples of "explanations" that I think are, frankly, garbage: [1](https://www.fxstreet.com/education/lessons-from-the-pros-forex-201106280000), [2](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/wAzZ5VBq-TVIX-Futures-Pivotal-Point/), [3](https://www.kotaksecurities.com/blog/intelligence/technical-funda/heres-how-to-use-golden-ratio-and-fibonacci-sequence-in-trading.html).

I'm legally required, I think, to make clear that _I'm not providing investment advice!_ - but if you want to talk math and stocks, I'd be happy to chat. Just email.

### Video Games

I made a simple little game and got it featured on Steam! It's called [Quatris](https://store.steampowered.com/app/888140/Quatris/) and it's _Free_, wow, what a steal! I made it with my friends Charlie and Cole in high school but didn't put it online until a while later. Hey, it even has achievements!

### Puzzles

I enjoy attending [MIT Mystery Hunt](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/) each year, and [other](http://2018.caltechpuzzlehunt.org/), [similar](https://2020.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/), [events](https://2021.teammatehunt.com/).
